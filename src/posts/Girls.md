From the spot where girls had peeled electrical wire out of the walls and wrapped it around their shoulders like cloaks, stood the clone of the long-deceased military leader, Napoleon.

That new Napoleon wouldn’t look you in the eye or attack prey.

“They killed the elk and they didn’t let me see it,” he said, tears streaming down his face.

Those girls just laughed and went back to locating precious stones by sound.

In the suburbs of New York on Valentine’s Day, other girls explain the connection between the nervous system and the muscles developed for a life in trees.

They want a Napoleon clone of their very own.

To sit him at the edge of a dam and cover him in lace. They said, “He’d be just like a baby we could throw into a bouncy castle.”

Those girls, their fathers had been sent to prison for the murder of grain dealers.

They know the day sends a pulse of radio waves through the burnt-out shells of cars.

It’s as if life in its truest form was elsewhere,

sitting under the asbestos in the crawl space where one girl spits out sunflower seed shells. She’d just carried a slain deer through the abandoned lot, kicked up her heels like a show pony the whole way.

The weather was just like this,

driving wild things back into the night.

Blades of grass biting the ankles, then wind-borne seeds colonizing the slopes of a recently erupted volcano

while girls twisted their bodies to stop fragments of glass from burying their town.

Then I grew ashamed of myself for not helping them,

for staying home and throwing roasted chestnuts down to the hungry girl stuck in a well.

Her voice reached up and said, “What they don’t understand is that if you stay on land too long, you become human.”
